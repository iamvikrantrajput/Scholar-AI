Linear programming (LP) is a powerful mathematical optimization technique with the following characteristics:

## Definition
Linear programming seeks to optimize (maximize or minimize) a linear objective function subject to a set of linear equality or inequality constraints.

## Key Components
- **Objective Function**: A linear function to be optimized
- **Decision Variables**: Variables whose values we want to determine
- **Constraints**: Linear inequalities or equations that limit feasible solutions

## Applications
- Resource allocation in manufacturing
- Portfolio optimization in finance  
- Transportation and logistics planning
- Production scheduling

The simplex algorithm, developed by George Dantzig in 1947, is the most common solution method. (source: linear_programming_guide.pdf, page 15-18)"""

- LP: Faster computation | QP: More complex, slower solving
- LP: Guaranteed global optimum | QP: May have local optima
- LP: Simplex method | QP: Interior point methods

**Step 2: Constraint Setup**  
- List all resource limitations
- Express as linear inequalities

**Step 3: Mathematical Model**
- Write objective function: max/min cx
- Add constraints: Ax ‚â§ b, x ‚â• 0

**Step 4: Solution Method**
- Apply simplex algorithm or graphical method
